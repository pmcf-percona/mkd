It was because in between the transaction started by mysqldump and the fetching of GTID_EXECUTED, GTIDs on the server could have increased already. With this fixed, a FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK is performed before the fetching of GTID_EXECUTED to ensure its value is consistent with the snapshot taken by mysqldump.</p> <p>The MySQL fix also added a requirement when using --single-transaction and executing FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK for the RELOAD privilege. (MySQL bug #109701, MySQL bug #105761)</p> <p>The Percona Server version of the <code>mysqldump</code> utility, in some modes, can be used with MySQL Server. This utility provides a temporary workaround for the \"additional RELOAD privilege\" limitation introduced by Oracle MySQL Server 8.0.32. </p> <p>For more information, see the Percona Performance Blog A Workaround for the \"RELOAD/FLUSH_TABLES privilege required\" Problem When Using Oracle mysqldump 8.0.32.</p> </li> <li> <p>In Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.29-21, the default ALTER TABLE algorithm was deliberately changed from <code>INSTANT</code> to <code>INPLACE</code> for safety reasons (find more details in Percona XtraBackup 8.0.29 and INSTANT ADD/DROP Columns blog post.) Since Oracle fixed the most critical bugs related to <code>ALGORITHM=INSTANT</code> in MySQL 8.0.32, Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.32-24 returns the original (upstream) behavior. Now, the default ALTER TABLE algorithm for supported DDL column operations is <code>INSTANT</code>.  </p> </li> </ul> <p>Improvements and bug fixes introduced by Oracle for MySQL 8.0.32 and included in Percona Server for MySQL are the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>A replica can add a Generated Invisible Primary Keys(GIPK) to any InnoDB table. To achieve this behavior, the GENERATE value is added as a possible value for the CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO statement\u2019s REQUIRE_TABLE_PRIMARY_KEY_CHECK option.</p> </li> <li> <p>The <code>REQUIRE_TABLE_PRIMARY_KEY_CHECK = GENERATE</code> option can be used on a per-channel basis.</p> </li> <li> <p>Setting <code>sql_generate_invisible_primary_key</code> on the source is ignored by a replica because this variable is not replicated. This behavior is inherited from the previous releases.</p> </li> <li> <p>An upgrade from 8.0.28 caused undetectable problems, such as server exit and corruption.</p> </li> <li> <p>A fix for after an upgrade, all columns added with ALGORITHM=INSTANT materialized and have version=0 for any new row inserted. Now, a column added with ALGORITHM=INSTANT fails if the maximum possible size of a row exceeds the row size limit, so that all new rows with materialized ALGORITHM=INSTANT columns are within row size limit. (Bug #34558510)</p> </li> <li> <p>After a drop, adding a specific column using the INSTANT algorithm could cause a data error and a server exit. (Bug #34122122)</p> </li> <li> <p>An online rebuild DDL no longer crashes after a column is added with ALGORITHM=INSTANT. Thank you Qingda Hu for reporting this bug.
